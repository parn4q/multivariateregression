This repository contains R code and a powerpoint of my project in my multivariate class.  In my project, we conducted an analysis on quarterions and whether or not these have a
relationship with gyros, accelerometers, and magnetometers.  I used mulitvariate regression to compare my results with the gentleman who conducted his own analysis.
